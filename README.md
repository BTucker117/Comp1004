Project Vision

My vision for this project is to get a working site that users are able to log into and interact with in many different ways such as: Creating accounts, editing account content, auto generating passwords, password similarity recognition as well as a password time function to remind users to alter their passwords so that it doesn't become old and out dated.

I want my site to look professional and clean as if it were in the main stream and activly being used by a business. This will provided a hightened experience for users as they would find it hard to tell this is only for a university project and not a real functioning website.
